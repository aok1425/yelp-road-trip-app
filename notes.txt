really weird error sf to sonoma county

do as few rewrites of resto_table as possible

try to make just_best a global or class var


figure out import * thing, esp w colums dict in write_results_file

just_best = True

def sth():
	if just_best==True:
		print 'just_best is True, and I can find out without passing the var to this fn'

#but then there's sth funny when i from sth import *


def fn2():
	if games==True:
		print 'games==true'

def fn1():
	games=True
	fn2()
