diff btwn .env and not using .env is that
the prog will pull the env vars from my real ones
aka wht i have in .bashrc

even if i have a .env, if i don't use 'foreman start'
prog will only look at my computer's env vars

so basically, if i need env vars, use 'foreman start'
otherwise i can use flask w debug=True
